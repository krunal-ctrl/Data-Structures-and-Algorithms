## About this Course
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: 
sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory:
how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; 
when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, 
designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second)



## Instructor's Note


Thanks for signing up for Algorithmic Toolbox! We are excited that the class is beginning and look forward to interacting with you!

The class covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and many others, You will learn how to sort and search data, how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; how to pack your knapsack using greedy algorithms, and how to search for similarities between genes using dynamic programming. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing them as efficient software tools.

We look forward to seeing you in this class! We know it will make you a better programmer.
